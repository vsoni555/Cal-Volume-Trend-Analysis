# Cal-Volume-Trend-Analysis
This project is focused on solving the problem statements by leveraging data. Excel was used to solve the case study.

Description:
Dataset of a Customer Experience (CX) Inbound calling team for 23 days. Data includes Agent_Name, Agent_ID, Queue_Time [duration for which customer have to wait before they get connected to an agent], Time [time at which call was made by customer in a day], Time_Bucket [for easiness we have also provided you with the time bucket], Duration [duration for which a customer and executives are on call, Call_Seconds, call status (Abandon, answered, transferred

Case Study Objectives:

1.Calculate the average call time duration for all incoming calls received by agents (in each Time_Bucket).
2.Show the total volume/ number of calls coming in via charts/ graphs [Number of calls v/s Time]. You can select time in a bucket form (i.e. 1-2, 2-3, â€¦..)
3.As you can see current abandon rate is approximately 30%. Propose a manpower plan required during each time bucket [between 9am to 9pm] to reduce the abandon rate to 10%. (i.e. You have to calculate minimum number of agents required in each time bucket so that at least 90 calls should be answered out of 100.)
